          <p>
              <span>"I'm home!" Kara Zor-El announced as she walked inside. "Da- oh, hi Uncle Jor."</span>
          </p>

            <p>
              <span>"Hello, Kara," Jor El said. "Your father and I are arguing about physics again. Care to be a tie-breaker?"</span>
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>"I'll buy you a gallon of ice cream if you say I'm right," Zor El said with a grin on his face, before ruffling his daughter's hair as she approached the table. It was where the family would be eating dinner, later, but for now, it was where a man argued with his brother and taught his daughter some extra science on the side. Kryptonian public education was all well and good, as a starting point, but a starting point was useless if you didn't progress from there. "We are... arguing about the physics that would best enable practical interstellar travel."</span>
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>"...Is there some sort of <em>barrier</em> around the solar system we haven't learned about in school?" Kara asked.</span>
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>"No, no, nothing like that," Zor said, shaking his head. "The stars are just very far away, and it would take a very long time to visit them with our current technology. Hence, <em>practical."</em></span>
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>"Oh, right," Kara muttered. "So, what would make it more practical?"</span>
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>"That's what we're arguing over," Jor said, running a hand back through his messy brown hair. He ran a little darker than his older brother; between Jor and his wife, Kara wouldn't be surprised if her eventual baby cousin came out with completely black hair. "We both agree that the answer is to shorten the distance a ship would have to travel, but where we disagree is <em>how."</em></span>
            </p>

            <p>
              <span><em>"I</em> believe that the solution lies in already-existing wormhole technology," Zor said.</span>
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>"Oh! We're learning about that at school!" Kara said. "Um. The teacher mentioned that we use it to take matter and energy directly out of the sun. And I asked her if that was safe and she said that wasn't part of the lesson plan, and that we had to move on."</span>
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>"Some would argue that it's reasonably safe," Zor said. "The sun is very big, and it would take a *lot* of work to break it."</span>
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>"But you don't think so," Kara said quietly.</span>
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>"...Let's just say there's a reason we're trying to solve interstellar travel," Jor said quietly. "The problem with wormholes, and why I think they won't work, is that they rely on the curvature of spacetime, and so they only work over relatively short distances within the solar system. People have been trying to open wormholes between us and other stars for centuries. And... it never works."</span>
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>"Then what's <em>your</em> idea?" Kara asked.</span>
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>"Gravity manipulation," Jor said. "If we can create a device that pinches space around it, then it will shorten the distance we need to travel, and we'll be able to stride between stars with conventional spaceflight, as easily as we can take a trip to the moon."</span>
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>"I thought gravity manipulation was impossible," Kara said.</span>
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>"It isn't <em>impossible,</em> it's just technology we haven't invented yet," Zor said. "Whereas the wormholes are technology we <em>have</em> invented, but... can't quite work how I need them to." He sighed. "Maybe one day, if I beat my head against this wall hard enough, the wall will break instead of my skull. Until then, I think this is enough physics for one day."</span>
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>"I'm sorry, brother," Jor said gently.</span>
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>Zor El sighed again, shaking his head and whispering. "We'll <em>all</em> be sorry, soon enough."</span>
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>---</span>
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>"That was it, then?" Kara asked quietly, in English. The language had been hard to learn, but then, it wasn't like she had anything better to be doing these days. "There weren't any pods after the two of us?"</span>
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>"Not as far as anyone here could detect," Kal El said, shaking his head. She'd known that sending him first had knocked something loose in the gravitic array, but still, arriving thirty years apart had been quite the shock when she first woke up. Now <em>she</em> was the baby cousin. "There's been one other Kryptonian, but he came here differently than you did."</span>
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>"The scientists told me about General Zod," Kara said quietly. "Said he was the reason behind Kryptonian Containment Protocol." Kal winced. "I appreciate you making this exception for me, letting me see the stars. They look so... different, from this planet."</span>
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>"I'll take your word for it," Kal said quietly. "I've never seen Krypton's night sky."</span>
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>"Oh, you have, once upon a time," Kara said. "You just don't remember it. On the night you were born, your father took you out onto the balcony, and held you so the two of you could watch the stars together. He loved the night sky. We all did, our family." She swallowed quietly, the corners of her eyes starting to sting.</span>
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>"What..." Kal cleared his throat quietly. "What was he like?"</span>
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>"He was..." Kara paused, searching for words. "He got so sad, sometimes, looking at the night sky. One night, I asked him why. And he said... he said he was looking at the bright lights of a million places he'd never go." She sniffed. "When you were born, he said he hoped you'd get to see at least one of them."</span>
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>"...I did, didn't I?" Kal said, looking up at the stars.</span>
            </p>
